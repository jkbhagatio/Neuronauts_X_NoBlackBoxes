The above implementation of wall-e gpt uses Python and Arduino to:
1. Process and stream a live video feed
2. Performing real-time speech-to-text via OpenAI's Whisper on a live audio feed
3. Wirelessly communicate and keep in memory a conversation with GPT-4 via OpenAI's GPT API, 
4. Program an interface for ChatGPT to control the robotâ€™s motors
5. Implement multithreading to perform multiple these tasks simultaneously
